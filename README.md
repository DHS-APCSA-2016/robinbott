PROJECT TITLE: RobinBot
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a BluJay based Java program modeled after
		    the Magpie Activity we did in class.
VERSION or DATE: 1.0.0
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the ChatBot class and this should give
                           you the ability to interact with RobinBot.
AUTHORS: Vishnu Chadalavada, Yashila Bordag
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run the ChatBot class and this should give you the
                   ability to interact with RobinBot. Then type in what-
                   ever you want to say to RobinBot.
PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS: The code has a two layer process, a runner which 
                    continues to prompt the user until they give a kill-
                    phrase and the RobinBot Class which returns the 
                    appropriate answers. In the RobinBot class, inputs 
                    are sifted through for keyphrases and if these key-
                    phrases or structures are identified, a response 
                    is made accordingly. In other cases, where the input
                    is unclear, a random response is given to clarify 
                    and prompt conversation.
